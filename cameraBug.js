This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component and manifests as an unexpected behavior or a blank screen where the camera preview should be. It doesn't always trigger a clear error message in the console, making it challenging to debug.  The underlying cause often involves misconfigurations in how the camera permissions are handled or issues with accessing the device's camera hardware.
