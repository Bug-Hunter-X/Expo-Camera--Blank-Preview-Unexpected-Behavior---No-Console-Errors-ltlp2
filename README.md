# Expo Camera: Blank Preview/Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive bug encountered when using Expo's Camera API. The issue manifests as a blank preview or unexpected behavior from the camera component, often without any clear error messages in the console. This makes debugging particularly challenging.

## Problem

The `Camera` component fails to display a preview. The console shows no error, only a blank or malfunctioning camera display.  This might be related to permissions issues, or problems with accessing the camera hardware itself.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates robust permission handling using `expo-permissions` along with explicit checks to ensure the camera is available and properly configured before attempting to render the preview.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the blank camera preview.

## How to Fix the Bug

1. Examine the `cameraBugSolution.js` file.  It incorporates improved permission handling and checks for camera availability.
2. Adapt the solution to your project, ensuring your camera configuration is correct and that you handle permissions effectively.
